# 🌟 Pokedex

This is a Pokédex app built with the following technologies:

## ✨ Features

This Pokédex lets you catch 'em all in different ways:
1. 🔍 Look up a single Pokémon by name (perfect for when you know exactly who you're looking for!)
2. 📝 Search multiple Pokémon at once by their names (gotta compare 'em all!)
3. 🏷️ Filter Pokémon by their type (want all Fire types? We got you!)

Additionally, the app includes pagination to help manage the display of Pokémon. 📚
